Pharmaceutical Inventory Database

For this project, I built a complete inventory management system using MySQL for a fictional pharmacist, Chief Lekwot Ejejigbe Edet, who runs 13 shops across Nigeria. 
The goal was to showcase my skills in SQL, database design, and data automation.

I designed a clean, relational schema that captures real-world pharmacy operations—covering products, branches, sales, etc. 
I ensured the structure followed best practices, including proper indexing, foreign key constraints, and normalized tables to avoid redundancy.

To simulate realistic activity, I generated synthetic data across all branches. 
I also wrote stored procedures and triggers to handle business logic. 
One highlight: a trigger that auto-detects when a product is sold and flags it for automatic replenishment—ensuring inventory stays up to date without manual effort.

This project demonstrates my ability to build scalable, real-time systems for retail environments. 
It brings together data integrity, transaction management, and automation into one cohesive database solution.
